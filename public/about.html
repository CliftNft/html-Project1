<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Firstly, the most famous aspect of Odisha tourism is its temples. 
  Jagannath Temple in Puri is one of the four Dhams of India. Even more, the Sun Temple of Konark is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
  Secondly, Odisha has an approximately 450 km coastline forming golden sandy beaches. 
  Thirdly, dozens of tribal villages are scattered around Odisha to learn and grow to a whole new level. 
  Indeed, Odisha in India is one of the best places to foster physical, emotional, intellectual, social, or spiritual connections.</p>

<p>What if I tell you that you can trace the best transformative travel experiences in Eastern India? 
  All you need to do is bookmark Odisha on your travel bucket list. This Eastern Indian state is surrounded by 
  Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal. Even more, Odisha is well connected with the entire India. 
  From foreigners to Indian tourists, everyone gets drawn to the tourist places in Odisha. 
  Wondering why? Well, Odisha allows tourists to encapsulate the joy of experiential travel at its best. </p>

<p>Raise your hands and ears if a sculpted chariot-shaped Hindu monument (Konark Sun Temple), 
  an ancient cave with ornate rock carvings (Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves), springs to mind when you think of popular 
  tourist places in Odisha. Moreover, some of you might be picturing a wetland lagoon (Chilika Lake )with many bird species, 
  kid-friendly picnic spots (Nandankanan Zoological Park), century-old museums, art & culture centers. 
  Hats off if you even think about its stunning coastline, as one of them is a popular beach and a sacred site for pilgrims.

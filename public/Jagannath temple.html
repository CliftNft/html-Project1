<h1>Jagannath Temple Puri</h1>
<p>Jagannath Temple is dedicated to Lord Odisha – Lord Krishna (main deity) and Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra. <br />
  Most importantly, Jagannath Temple is one of the Bada Char Dhams of India and hence, <br />
  one of the must-visit places in Odisha’s Puri district. Unlike the other temples, <br />
  Jagannath Temple’s main deities’ statues are carved and sculpted from wood. <br />
  The temple authority replaces the deities made from wood every year as a ritual. <br />
  You must visit Jagannath Temple during the annual famous Rath Yatra Chariot Festival held in June/July.</p>

  <p>When you enter Jagannath Temple through any of its four gates, witness the 65 m high spire that dominates Puri’s skyline. <br />
    At the same time, only Hindu devotees are allowed to enter the temple. <br />
    The classic duel style of Kalinga architecture is impressive and is a crowd puller (but remember, the temple is no photography zone). <br />
    Surprise to many, there are around 24 different festivals held at the Jagannath Temple <br />
    that are celebrated by local people and tourists alike with full fervor. If you have time in hand, <br />
    make sure to visit each of the small (sub) shrines scattered around the temple’s main complex.</p>
